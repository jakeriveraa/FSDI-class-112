<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey, I'm Jake â€” the kind of person who's always chasing curiosity. Whether I'm
  diving into creative projects, figuring out how things work, or just enjoying
  time with good people, I like staying inspired and keeping things real. I'm
  all about growth, good conversations, and making moments count. Life,s too
  short to stay in one lane, so I'm always up for trying something new.
</p>
